Objective
  desiging the autonomous car driving
  create a platfarm to take input for car with custom attribute and perform testing (or perform particular tagged test scenario)
  Tagging a particular test scenario


CAR DRIVING ATTRIBUTE

  STEERING
  BREAK
  ACCELERATION

CAR ATTRIBUTE

  FRONT CAMERA (IMAGE PROCESSING)
  REAR CAMERA (IMAGE PROCESSING)
  VOICE PROCESSING (for passenger command)
  SENSORS
  SPEEDO METER
  FUEL METER
  DOOR LOCKER
  AIR Pressue
  TEMPRATURE METER (A/C or heater)
  VEDIO RECORDER
  AIRBAGS
  WIPPER


EXTERNAL CONDITIONS

  ROAD CONDITIONS

    shape_attribute#    straight
                        curve
    load_attribute#     elevated
                        esclated
    Surface_attribute#  rough
                        muddy
    //road conditions can be combination of A | B | C i.e straight + muddy + elevated

  WEATHER CONDITIONS
    NORMAL
    COLD
    HOT
    RAINY
    CLOUDY
    THUNDERSTORM

  ROUTE SERVICE
    to decide route

  GEOLOCATION_TIMING SERVICE

  TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
    PEOPLE DENSITY () ??
    TRAFFICE SIGN PROCESSING
    OBJECT PROCESSING
    ??


CAR JOURNEY LIFE CYCLE

  START
      At car start initializing its state
      checking all the validity (insurance + rc + pollution + etc w.r.t region )
      checking car health
      giving instruction to move input Source -> Destination,

  TRANSITION
      while moving processing the data stream from camera and taking decision
      Processing passenger command i.e car stop in between

  STOP
      Destination reached

CORE RULE ENGINE
  to process data stream in real time , taking decision and instructing car driving attribute i.e (STEERING | BREAK | ACCELERATION)
    training the route (with detailed frame by frame 3d graph processing)
    compute new objects

Sending out the data stream for the GPS location to the command center ??
